=======

A simple text editor with a built-in browser to rapidly build Bootstrap pages

Notes
=====
* Solution file created by Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate. Just extract the sources (/*.cs) and embed in your project if you don't happen to have VS 2013.
* Templates come from the snippets.xml file and is easily extensible by adding new nodes
* The snippets are read only once upon startup (i.e, app requires recycle to see any changes made to it for now)

TODO
=====

* Replace Textbox control with a real editor control (ICSharp)
* Add saving and loading pages
* Provide a tabbed interface to switch between files
* Allow testing on different versions of browsers (currently only embeds IE)
